This document outlines what I actually practiced during Week 2 of my IT Support Lab: using Jira Service Management to simulate real Tier 1 support ticket workflows.

This is not technical troubleshooting — it’s about learning how IT support teams use ticketing systems like Jira to track, manage, and resolve user-reported issues.

 What I Practiced – In Detail

1.  Creating Tickets Manually

I created tickets manually in Jira by clicking “Create” and filling out realistic values:

Summary: A short sentence explaining the issue (e.g., "User account locked")

Description: A detailed explanation of the issue, including what the user is experiencing

Priority: Set depending on urgency (e.g., Medium or High)

Issue Type: Chose Task or Incident

Assignee: Assigned to myself (as I was the only user in the simulation)

2.  Changing Ticket Statuses

I simulated status transitions like a real IT technician:

Open: Ticket created and unassigned or not yet worked on

In Progress: When I began working on the ticket (e.g., writing internal notes)

Pending: When the issue required escalation (e.g., Networking or Exchange)

Resolved: When I finalized the simulated fix and sent a closing message

Each transition reflected a real workflow stage in IT support.

3.  Writing Internal Notes

I used the Internal Comment feature to:

Document what steps would have been taken by a tech (e.g., "Would check AD for lockout")

Show investigation logic (e.g., "User confirmed OWA working, so Outlook issue is local")

Internal notes are not seen by the user but are essential for team collaboration and escalations.

4.  Writing Public Replies

I practiced public replies for every ticket to:

Acknowledge the issue

Provide clear status updates

Confirm when a fix was applied

Explain next steps in plain English

Public replies simulate what users see as email responses or helpdesk updates.

5.  Simulating Escalations

In more complex tickets, I simulated escalation by:

Writing internal notes like "Escalating to Networking Team for DNS investigation"

Changing ticket status to Pending

This reflects what real Tier 1 techs do when they can’t resolve an issue directly.

6.  Closing the Ticket with Resolution

Each ticket was marked Resolved only after:

Adding a final public reply confirming the outcome

Choosing a resolution category (e.g., Done)

Ensuring internal documentation was complete

This mirrored how actual IT teams wrap up and log work.

📁 Example Tickets I Simulated in Jira

Ticket

Description

1. Account Locked

Simulated unlocking account and resetting password

2. VPN Auth Error

Simulated credentials reset and successful login

3. VPN Tunnel Up, Apps Down

Escalated due to internal network unreachable

4. Outlook Sync Issue

Guided through cache clearing and OWA check

5. Print Job Stuck

Simulated spooler restart and cleared queue
