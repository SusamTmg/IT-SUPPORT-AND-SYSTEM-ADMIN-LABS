# Ticketing System Visual Log

This document provides visual evidence of simulated IT support tickets managed in Jira Service Management as part of Week 2 of the IT Support Lab Portfolio. Each screenshot captures a specific stage of the support process, from ticket creation to resolution. The goal is to demonstrate a hands-on understanding of ticket handling, proper documentation, and professional communication within a typical helpdesk workflow.

### **Ticket 1 â€“ User Account Locked**
This screenshot captures a simulated Jira ticket where a user is unable to log in due to multiple failed login attempts. The issue was classified under the **Active Directory** component with **Medium** priority. A professional public reply was added to inform the user about the resolution process, while an internal note documents the investigation steps taken by the IT support technician.
