# 02 – Simulated Ticket Creation & Workflow in Jira

This document outlines what I actually practiced during Week 2 of my IT Support Lab: using **Jira Service Management** to simulate real Tier 1 support ticket workflows.

---

##  What I Practiced – In Detail

### 1. Creating Tickets Manually
I created tickets manually in Jira by clicking **"Create"** and filling out realistic values:

- **Summary:** A short sentence explaining the issue (e.g., "User account locked")
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the issue, including what the user is experiencing
- **Priority:** Set depending on urgency (e.g., Medium or High)
- **Issue Type:** Chose Task or Incident
- **Assignee:** Assigned to myself (as I was the only user in the simulation)

---

### 2. Changing Ticket Statuses
I simulated status transitions like a real IT technician:

- **Open:** Ticket created and unassigned or not yet worked on  
- **In Progress:** When I began working on the ticket (e.g., writing internal notes)  
- **Pending:** When the issue required escalation (e.g., Networking or Exchange)  
- **Resolved:** When I finalized the simulated fix and sent a closing message

Each transition reflected a real workflow stage in IT support.

---

### 3. Writing Internal Notes
I used the **Internal Comment** feature to:

- Document what steps would have been taken by a tech (e.g., "Would check AD for lockout")
- Show investigation logic (e.g., "User confirmed OWA working, so Outlook issue is local")

> Internal notes are not seen by the user but are essential for team collaboration and escalation.

---

### 4. Writing Public Replies
I practiced writing clear, polite **user-facing replies** for every ticket:

- Acknowledge the issue
- Provide clear status updates
- Confirm when a fix was applied
- Explain next steps in plain English

> Public replies simulate what users see as email responses or portal messages.

---

### 5. Simulating Escalations
In more complex tickets, I simulated escalation by:

- Writing internal notes like _"Escalating to Networking Team for DNS investigation"_
- Changing ticket status to **Pending**

This reflects what real Tier 1 techs do when they can’t resolve an issue directly.

---

### 6. Closing the Ticket with Resolution
Each ticket was marked **Resolved** only after:

- Adding a final **public reply** confirming the outcome
- Choosing a **resolution category** (e.g., Done)
- Making sure internal notes were complete

This mirrored how real IT teams wrap up and log work properly.

## Example Tickets I Simulated in Jira

| Ticket                     | Description                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Account Locked         | Simulated unlocking account and resetting password       |
| 2. VPN Auth Error         | Simulated credentials reset and successful login         |
| 3. VPN Tunnel Up, Apps Down | Escalated due to internal network unreachable         |
| 4. Outlook Sync Issue     | Guided through cache clearing and OWA check              |
| 5. Print Job Stuck        | Simulated spooler restart and cleared print queue        |

## What I Learned

- How tickets flow through a real IT system: Open → In Progress → Pending → Resolved
- The difference between internal notes and public replies
- How to simulate professional behavior as an IT support technician
- How to document work clearly and honestly, even at a beginner level
