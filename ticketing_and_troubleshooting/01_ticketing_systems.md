# 01 – What Is an IT Ticketing System?

An IT ticketing system is a tool used by technical support teams to log, track, manage, and resolve user-reported issues. It helps IT departments organize their workflow, prioritize incidents, assign tasks, and maintain accountability across multiple support levels.

I used **Jira Service Management** to simulate how real companies manage technical issues using a structured ticketing process.

## Why Ticketing Systems Matter in IT Support

In real work environments like banks, hotels, universities, and corporate offices, IT teams rely on ticketing systems to:

- Record every issue in a centralized platform
- Assign tickets to the right technician or team
- Communicate clearly with users (via public replies)
- Log internal investigations (private/internal notes)
- Track resolution time and performance metrics (SLA compliance)
- Escalate more complex issues to Level 2 or Level 3 support

Without ticketing systems, IT teams would struggle to stay organized, communicate efficiently, or prove compliance during audits.

## Ticket Lifecycle: From Report to Resolution

Every IT ticket follows a standard lifecycle:

```text
User reports issue ➝ Ticket created ➝ Assigned to tech ➝ Investigation begins ➝ Fix applied ➝ Resolution confirmed ➝ Ticket closed
