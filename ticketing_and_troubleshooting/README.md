# Week 2 â€“ IT Support Ticketing & Troubleshooting

In Week 2 of my IT Support Lab Portfolio, I simulated how real IT teams use ticketing systems to manage and resolve user issues. Using Jira Service Management, I created and resolved realistic support tickets involving login failures, VPN problems, printer spooler issues, and Outlook sync errors.

I also wrote SOPs and end-user-friendly explanations based on each ticket, just like IT support teams do in production environments.
