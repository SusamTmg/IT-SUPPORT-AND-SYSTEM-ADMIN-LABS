# IT-System-Lab-Portfolio-
A hands-on IT lab portfolio, independently developed to simulate enterprise IT environments and demonstrate practical skills in system administration, Active Directory, Microsoft 365 identity management, and endpoint security.
This portfolio is developed from scratch to reflect the exact tasks IT professionals perform in the workplace — with structured weekly modules, practical labs, and documentation of every fix, misconfiguration, and lesson learned along the way.

## Objective

To build a strong, practical foundation in system administration and enterprise IT operations by simulating real company scenarios:

- Managing Windows Server & Clients in a virtual lab  
- Administering Microsoft 365 and Entra ID (Azure AD) users  
- Enforcing Group Policies (GPO), backups, Intune device management  
- Troubleshooting login issues, DNS failures, RDP access, and endpoint security  

This portfolio is built with **curiosity and consistency**, documenting not just what worked — but how things broke, how they were fixed, and what I learned.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to learn by doing — not just watching. By building and breaking my own IT environment, I gained confidence in:

- Troubleshooting systems under pressure  
- Documenting issues clearly  
- Communicating technical steps and decisions like a real support engineer  

This portfolio reflects my hands-on journey into IT system administration and enterprise infrastructure. I created it to stay accountable, learn by doing, and build real-world confidence beyond theory and certifications.

## What's Next

This lab is only the beginning. In the coming months, I plan to:

- Expand into more Microsoft 365 & Azure administration labs  
- Explore Intune policies and Autopilot deployment  
- Start practicing mock tickets using Jira/ServiceNow  
- Pursue the **MD-102** and **AZ-900** certifications

> If you're a mentor reviewing this — thank you. I’m not perfect, but I’m persistent, and I believe skill comes from practice. This repo is my practice, and I’m just getting started.
