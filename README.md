# IT-Support-AND-System-Admin-Lab-Portfolio-

A hands-on portfolio simulating real-world IT environments: focused on support workflows, identity management, system administration, and Microsoft technologies.

Built from scratch to mirror the responsibilities of entry-level IT Support and Junior Sysadmin roles, this project documents every lab, fix, failure, and breakthrough with clarity and purpose.

## Objective

To build job-ready expertise in modern IT support and systems administration by simulating real-world company scenarios:

- Managing Windows Server environments (AD DS, DNS, GPO, RDP)
- Administering Microsoft 365 / Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Implementing Group Policies, RODC setup, and IFM-based DC promotion
- Practicing PowerShell scripting for account, policy, and access management
- Troubleshooting login failures, DNS issues, RDP access, NTFS permissions
- Preparing for certifications: **MD-102**, **AZ-900**

This portfolio reflects a mindset of **discipline and deep curiosity**, documenting not just what worked but, *what broke, how it was fixed,* and *what was learned* along the way.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to learn by doing — not just watching. By building and breaking my own IT environment, I gained confidence in:

- Troubleshooting systems under pressure  
- Documenting issues clearly  
- Communicating technical steps and decisions like a real support engineer  

This portfolio reflects my hands-on journey into IT system administration and enterprise infrastructure. I created it to stay accountable, learn by doing, and build real-world confidence beyond theory and certifications.

## What's Next

This lab is only the beginning. In the coming months, I plan to:

- Expand into more Microsoft 365 & Azure administration labs  
- Explore Intune policies and Autopilot deployment
- Pursue the **MD-102** and **AZ-900** certifications
