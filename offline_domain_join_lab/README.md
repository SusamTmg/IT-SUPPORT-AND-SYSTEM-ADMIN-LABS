#  Offline Domain Join Lab (Windows Server & Active Directory)

This lab demonstrates how to join a Windows 10 client to a Windows Server Active Directory domain using **Offline Domain Join (ODJ)** â€” a real-world enterprise technique used when client machines cannot directly connect to the Domain Controller during deployment.

It also includes **user account auditing**, **account lockout policy testing**, and **login rights configuration**, simulating the kind of identity management work performed by IT support and system administrators.

---

##  What I Practiced

- Using `djoin.exe` to provision a computer account and join it to the domain offline
- Copying domain metadata from the server to a remote client machine
- Importing the metadata and rebooting the client to finalize the domain join
- Enforcing security rules like **account lockout after failed login attempts**
- Using PowerShell to find **locked**, **disabled**, and **inactive** user accounts
- Granting and restricting **local and remote login permissions** through User Rights Assignment

##  Why This Matters in Real IT Jobs

> This lab is based on **exact tasks that real IT professionals do daily**, especially when supporting users in different offices or working remotely.

Companies use **Offline Domain Join** to:
- Pre-configure laptops for remote staff
- Deploy devices in low-connectivity environments
- Enforce centralized security policies through Active Directory

I have simulated those tasks here, showing my ability to work with:
- Windows Server
- PowerShell scripting
- Domain controller infrastructure
- Security policy enforcement
