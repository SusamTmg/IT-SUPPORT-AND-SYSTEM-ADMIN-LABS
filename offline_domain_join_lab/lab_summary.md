# Lab Summary – Offline Domain Join and User Account Management

This lab simulates a scenario where a Windows 10 client (PLABSA01) is joined to a Windows Server domain controller (PLABDC01) using an Offline Domain Join. It also includes account lockout policy enforcement, user account auditing with PowerShell, and secure login configuration via User Rights Assignment. These are foundational identity management skills expected in IT support and system admin roles.

### **Fig 1.0: Domain Controller Info – IP Configuration**
The ipconfig /all command was executed on the domain controller PLABDC01 to verify its IPv4 address, DNS server, and hostname.
This step ensures the server’s network settings are correct before performing any domain provisioning. The client needs this info (especially DNS) to communicate with the domain later.

### **Fig 1.1: Restart Command on PLABSA01**
A PowerShell command was used to immediately restart the client computer PLABSA01 using shutdown /r /t 0.
Restarting prepares the machine for domain joining, especially if changes like hostname or network settings were applied beforehand.

### **Figure 1.2: Deleting Old Computer Object from AD**
In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) on PLABDC01, a previous entry for PLABSA01 was deleted after a subtree confirmation.
This clears any outdated records that could conflict with the new join process — a common step when rejoining devices to a domain.

### **Figure 1.3: Successful Offline Domain Join File Creation**
A correct djoin.exe /provision command was executed on PLABDC01 to generate request.txt for the client PLABSA01.
This file contains all the metadata (domain info, SID, computer name) required for an offline domain join, allowing the client to join without direct contact with the server.

### **Figure 1.4: Mapping Network Drive from PLABSA01 to PLABDC01**
The PLABSA01 client mapped a network drive to access a shared folder on the domain controller PLABDC01.
This allowed the offline domain join file (request.txt) to be transferred from the server to the client. A network drive is a simple and secure way to move files between machines on the same LAN.

---
### **Figure 1.5: Copying Join File to the Client via File Explorer**
Using File Explorer, the request.txt file was successfully copied from the mapped network drive to the local drive of PLABSA01.
 This transfer prepares the client machine to run the domain join process offline using the file generated by djoin.

### **Figure 1.6: Importing the Join File on PLABSA01 and Restarting**
The command djoin /requestODJ was used on PLABSA01 to import the provisioning file, followed by a system restart.
This completes the offline domain join process. The machine uses the metadata file to securely join the domain, even without live server access.

---
### **Figure 1.7: Domain Join Confirmed in Active Directory**
Back on PLABDC01, Active Directory Users and Computers displayed PLABSA01 under the domain — confirming the join was successful.
This proves the offline domain join process worked correctly, and the client is now a trusted device in the domain.

### **Figure 1.8: Account Lockout Threshold Configuration**
On the domain controller (PLABDC01), the Account Lockout Threshold setting was configured using the Local Security Policy tool. The value was set to trigger a lockout after a defined number of failed login attempts.
This step enforces a common security policy in enterprise environments, preventing brute-force login attempts by locking the account after repeated failures.

---
### **Figure 1.9: Locked Out Login Attempt on PLABWIN10**
After intentionally entering the wrong password several times on the client (PLABWIN10), the Windows login screen displayed a lockout message.
This confirms the lockout policy is functioning as expected and that domain security settings are successfully being applied to client machines.

### **Figure 1.9: PowerShell Summary of Locked-Out Accounts**
A PowerShell command was executed on PLABDC01 to display a list of users currently locked out of their accounts using:
Search-ADAccount -LockedOut

This is a real-world support task — IT staff use it to identify which users are locked out and take action (e.g., unlocking, resetting passwords).

---
### **Figure 1.10 & 1.11: Listing Disabled User Accounts**
The command:
Search-ADAccount -AccountDisabled

was run to list all domain user accounts that are disabled.
This is important for auditing — disabled accounts often belong to former employees or deactivated test users. Regular checks help reduce security risks.

---
### **Figure 1.12 & 1.13: Listing Inactive User Accounts**
Using:
Search-ADAccount -AccountInactive -TimeSpan 1.00:00:00

the system returned a list of users who haven’t logged in for the past 1 day.
Inactive accounts are common in large networks, and auditing them helps IT clean up unused profiles or review why the user has been inactive.

### **Figure 1.14: Configuring 'Allow Log On Locally' Rights**
The User Rights Assignment setting "Allow log on locally" was accessed on PLABDC01. Specific security groups were reviewed or added to control who can sign in at the machine directly.
This is an important part of Windows Server security — admins often restrict local login access to prevent unauthorized physical access to critical systems.

---
### **Figure 1.15: Configuring RDP Access via Group Policy**
The "Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services" policy was modified to include specific user groups.
This enables remote users (like IT staff or remote workers) to securely access systems via RDP — a must-have in modern enterprise environments with hybrid work.

---
### **Figure 1.16: Remote Desktop Users Group Configuration**
The Remote Desktop Users group was edited using the system settings GUI to add authorized users.
This step is often used alongside group policies for finer access control. It ensures only approved users can connect remotely.

### **Figure 1.17: UAC Prompt for Administrative Permissions**
While making system-level changes, a User Account Control (UAC) prompt appeared, asking for administrator rights.
This shows that the actions performed — such as editing login permissions — required elevated privileges, confirming that you were performing real admin-level tasks in the system.
